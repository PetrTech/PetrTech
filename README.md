I know you're here probably because of the UGC code.
The puzzle is very simple this time. Go to my YouTube & X to get info.
The code is lowercase.
The code is a combination of (no spaces, just words in a row, like this: apple + banana = applebanana):
* My rhythm game
* The last word of my most popular video's (in terms of views) title (same form, has the S at the end)
* The name of my newest song (including special characters like $,.,!,? and so on)
* The amount of my subscribers (incase this changes during the challenge, the last digit is 3)
* The first letters from the starting texts from my 2 previous challenges (in order from newest to oldest, example: if i had 2 posts with starting texts "apple" & "banana", the result of these would be ab)
* My irl first name (pretty simple, no?)
